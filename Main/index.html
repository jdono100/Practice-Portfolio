                    <p>
                        Isn't it just the worst to have to write about yourself? What exactly is it that makes it so difficult for myself and others? 
                        Is it the existential dread that comes along with recalling memories that are best left undisturbed? 
                        For me, it's just the fact that I don't believe myself to be all that interesting, and I find writing about myself boring. I was born in Joliet, Illnois, raised in Channahon, 10 miles southwest, 
                        and graduated from Minooka Community High School in 2017. I've had steady employment since then, but I'm not in a field where I feel like I'm utilizing my full potential. 
                        I've always been into computers, have built my own since I was 12, and have been studying programming since I found out about this program 8 months ago.
                        I enrolled in the Northwestern Coding Boot Camp in February 2021, in the hopes of getting a job as an associate developer. There's a lot I still have to learn but I know I'm doing a pretty good job
                        so far and I'm excited for what's to come. :)
