# Week-02-HW-Portfolio

Personal Portfolio

This week we had to make a portfolio for ourselves using only HTML and CSS! It seemed kind of difficult at first, but 
I find this way of learning to be incredibly effective for me. Using obscure CSS on items is interesting although I'm sure I'll never 
use a lot of this stuff again because there are more efficient ways of doing it.
