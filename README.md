# Week-02-HW-Portfolio

Personal Portfolio

This week we had to make a portfolio for ourselves using only HTML and CSS! It seemed kind of difficult at first, but 
I find this way of learning to be incredibly effective for me. Using obscure CSS on items is interesting although I'm sure I'll never 
use a lot of this stuff again because there are more efficient ways of doing it. 

I struggled so so hard with the media queries. I believe it's because I added too much sloppy CSS and confused the computer and myself. I couldn't figure out why some things would respond well to changing the width and height, but some things just didn't want to cooperate. It's definitely rare for me to turn in an assignment that I don't feel I fully completed, but I've still spent an enormous amount of time on this and am ready for it to be over. Going forward, I will keep in mind that this is one of the most important CSS items we use, and will not wait until I'm all done to start messing around with it.
